“Sprint to Innovate pulls together students of various disciplines (technology, business, entrepreneurship, etc) from Manitoba post-secondary institutions (including our international partners) to learn about innovation, and collaborate in a fun and exciting challenge to build a minimum viable prototype in just two days.
Do you want to learn how to be innovative, and win some money?
Sprint to Innovate pulls together students of various disciplines (technology, business, entrepreneurship, etc) from Manitoba post-secondary institutions (including our international partners) to learn about innovation, and collaborate in a fun and exciting challenge to build a minimum viable prototype in just two days.
Sprint to Innovate is about learning innovation, being innovative, building deeper relationships, problem-solving and developing solutions to real business challenges. Whether you win, or not, you will have the skills to innovate, problem-solve, and work as a team.
How the event works
Teams of 3 to 5 students will be assigned a business challenge that industry provided. Students and mentors will then work together on a solution, including developing a prototype to be presented to judges on the final day. A prototype is a simple experimental model of the proposed product used to learn from. Prototypes range from low-fidelity (paper-based) prototypes that are used to explain concepts all the way to high-fidelity prototypes that have functional elements with more detail. Teams may consist of technology and business students.”

Outcome: 
The team of students worked all weekend to create their solution to the proposed problem, build their prototype, perform market research in their networks, and prepare a final pitch presentation. 

Team lead, Alex Gilmer, delivered a well-thought-out, aesthetically pleasing, and persuasive pitch on Sunday afternoon. **The team of four ended up winning first place and taking home the prize of $5,000 to share.**

Team Awesome Possum put together a solution for creating engagement in the online learning environment by creating gamification software to enhance the student experience. Gamification adds achievements, points, and rewards into the day-to-day learning platform to encourage students to complete challenges and increase their scores in the class as well as their overall understanding of the learning outcomes.

Question & Answer with Team Lead, Alex Gilmer:
What was the event?

A: The Sprint to Innovate Hackathon was a competition hosted by RRC Polytech and a number of Manitoba business sponsors to spur on teams of business and tech students to come up with innovative solutions to some problems affecting those businesses.  Student teams are paired up with business mentors to help guide them on their journey through the weekend. 

What was it like to participate in such an event (student perspective)?

A:  It was an absolute whirlwind.  There were so many things to do and so little time to do them.  I can’t say I was stressed (because I was having fun), but I would describe the experience as intense.  

Who was the team and how did your team work together (roles, division of work, communication)?

A: We were a group of four classmates.  I had the role of Team Leader.  I was the one that coordinated the activities of the other group members.  I delegated tasks, measured our progress, and kept us working in concert.  I also delivered the final presentation. 
Andrew Borondia was a natural fit for our Lead Developer.  Of the four of us, he probably has the strongest programming skills.  He set up our GitHub repository and did most of the program code for our prototype.  
Jie Chen took the role of Lead Designer.  I’ve previously witnessed first-hand her skills in the realm of aesthetic design.  These were skills that the rest of us sorely lacked, and she absolutely blew us away with her creativity.  
Hao Gong was the “Concept Planner” because of how instrumental he was in coming up with our Empathy Persona. He helped greatly in the role of “filling in the gaps”.  There were many tasks that fell outside of design creativity or program development, and many of those tasks fell to Hao. 

What challenges did your team face?

A: There were too many to count.  Innovation is a process with many steps.  Our most difficult challenge, I think, was research.  All of our talents fall within the realm of IT/programming.  None of us had the insight to perform market research until late in the evening before the judged presentations when our mentor came forward and said “You should test this prototype on some real people.”  What followed was a mad scramble to not only find subjects to interview, but also to incorporate our findings into the presentation.  

What did you learn from this experience? 

A: Time management is key.  When working on these kinds of tasks, it’s easy to get derailed with thoughts of “Oh, I could add this other thing…”.  Our mentor helped immensely with time-boxing our creative tasks.  “For the next 10 minutes, write down every idea for <blank>”.  

How has your education at MITT prepared you to succeed in this kind of event?

A: One of the first things we learned in class was “How to Google your way out of problems”.  This self-oriented problem-solving mindset was critical to our efforts.  We may not have used Google literally, but the emphasis on learning to solve your own problems came through.  The other thing was technology.  Over the course of the last 10 months at MITT, we’ve learned to use so many new technologies and the process of learning is now a snap for us.  Using new organizational software like MURAL and Pitch was a breeze.  

What was your project? (Concept and motivation, what did you build)

A: The basic principle was to merge the gaming concept of “achievements” into the school experience.  For those out of the loop, “achievements” are a common concept in games where a specific task is laid out for the player, and the player is rewarded for accomplishing it.  It’s usually accompanied by all the dopamine-inducing features the game devs can come up with, such as shiny animations, or cool-looking rewards.  

Why do you think your team won the event?

A: We put a lot of practice into our presentation pitch.  I think I test-delivered it 6 or 7 times before going on stage.  This contributed to one of the two major factors that I think held the most influence: we finished the presentation on time.  The other major factor, I think, was the lack of major technical malfunctions.  I would say that most competitors ran into one of those two problems, and that gave us an edge.  I’d like to brag and say that my energy and confidence in delivery were a plus, but on watching the replay, I can hear my own nerve-induced heavy breathing throughout the presentation :$ (embarrassed emoji).  I’m used to presenting to groups of up to 30, but that crowd was 70+ with judges and money on the line.  

What advice or recommendations would you have for students considering participating in Hackathons in the future?

A: Don’t be afraid of failure.  That’s one of the critical steps in innovation.  Ideas don’t always work, and that’s okay.  The important part of the process is the learning you do along the way.  I know that sounds cheesy, but I learned a lot from this event that will carry me for years to come.  Winning was just icing on the cake.  The team mentor is there to guide you, and you aren’t doing things right unless you’re enlisting their help.
